efficient for the following operations
- search
- insert
- delete 
- prefix search 
- lexicographical ordering of words

// COMPARISON WITH HASHING AND TRIE

// TRIE

SEARCH - theta(word length) in worst case
INSERT - "
DELETE - "
PREFIX SEARCH - theta(prefix len + output len)
LEXICOGRAPHIC ORDERING - theta(output len)

// HASHING

SEARCH - theta(word length) in average
INSERT - "
DELETE - "
PREFIX SEARCH - not supported
LEXICOGRAPHIC ORDERING - not supported
